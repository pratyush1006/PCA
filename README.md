# Clustering of Credit Card User using PCA
This project aims to cluster credit card users based on their spending behavior using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to identify groups of users with similar spending patterns and gain insights into their preferences and behaviors. This readme file provides an overview of the project, including the dataset used, the methodology employed, and instructions for running the code.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card users and their spending habits. Each instance in the dataset represents a user, and the features include variables such as credit limit, average monthly spending on different categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, travel), and payment history. The dataset does not contain the target variable since it is an unsupervised learning task.

# Methodology
The project follows these major steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. This step may include data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling to ensure that all features have a similar range.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the important information. This technique transforms the original features into a new set of orthogonal variables called principal components. The principal components are ranked in descending order of variance explained, and a subset of them is selected based on a chosen threshold (e.g., cumulative explained variance).

3. Clustering: The reduced-dimensional data obtained from PCA is clustered using a suitable clustering algorithm such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. Clustering assigns each user to a group based on their similarity in spending behavior. The number of clusters can be determined using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.

4. Visualization: The clustered data can be visualized using techniques like scatter plots or heatmaps to gain insights into the distinct spending patterns of different user groups.

# Results and Discussion
The results of the credit card user clustering, including visualizations and insights, will be displayed or saved to a file (as specified in the script). You can analyze these results to understand the spending patterns and preferences of different user clusters.

It is important to interpret the results carefully and consider the limitations of the clustering approach. The clusters obtained may not always have straightforward interpretations and may require further analysis or domain knowledge to derive meaningful insights.
